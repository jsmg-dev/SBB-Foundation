      <h2 class="center-heading">Nurturing cows with care on our ranch.</h2>
<p>At SBB Foundation, we believe that compassion extends to all living beings. Our cow ranch is more than just a shelter â€” it's a sanctuary where cows are nurtured with love, respect, and attentive care. We ensure they have a clean, healthy environment, regular nutrition, and medical support. Through our efforts, we promote ethical animal care while also using the ranch as a source of sustainable livelihood and education for underprivileged communities.</p>

      <h2 class="center-heading">Empowering Poor Children Through Education</h2>
<p>we believe education is the strongest tool to break the cycle of poverty. We are committed to providing underprivileged children with access to quality learning, supportive environments, and the resources they need to thrive. Through schools, tutoring programs, and skill-building workshops, we help children gain confidence, knowledge, and a brighter future. Every book, every class, and every moment of guidance brings them one step closer to a life of opportunity and dignity.</p>
