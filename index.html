	<p>Welcome to SBB Foundation
	SBB Foundation is a non-profit organization committed to creating a better future for underprivileged children and promoting sustainable rural development. We work passionately to provide quality education to children from poor backgrounds and operate a caring cow ranch that supports local farmers and ecological balance. Our mission is to uplift lives with compassion, knowledge, and community empowerment. Together, we believe we can build a world where every child learns with dignity and every cow lives with care.</p>
