  <h2 class="center-heading">Nurturing Cows with Care at Our Ranch</h2>
  <p style="padding: 0 2rem;">
    At SBB Foundation, we believe that every life deserves compassion. Our cow ranch is a peaceful space where cows are nurtured with love, proper care, and dignity. We provide them with nutritious food, clean shelter, and regular medical attention, ensuring a healthy and humane environment. Many of our cows are rescued or abandoned, and through our efforts, we give them a second chance at life. This initiative reflects our commitment to animal welfare and our broader mission of kindness and care for all living beings.
