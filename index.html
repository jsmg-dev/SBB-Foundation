      <h2 class="center-heading">Nurturing cows with care on our ranch.</h2>
	  <p>At SBB Foundation, we believe that every life deserves compassion. Our cow ranch is a peaceful space where cows are nurtured with love, proper care, and dignity. We provide them with nutritious food, clean shelter, and regular medical attention, ensuring a healthy and humane environment. Many of our cows are rescued or abandoned, and through our efforts, we give them a second chance at life. This initiative reflects our commitment to animal welfare and our broader mission of kindness and care for all living beings.</p>

We are committed to providing underprivileged children with access to quality learning, a safe environment, and the resources they need to grow and succeed. Through school support, tuition programs, and educational activities, we help children build confidence, gain knowledge, and dream of a better future. Our mission is to ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to learn, grow, and lead a life of dignity.<p/>
