    <h2>About SBB Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      SBB Foundation is a non-profit organization committed to uplifting underprivileged children through quality education and development programs. 
      Founded in 2015, it began as a response to the devastating earthquake in Nepal, which left over 1 million students without access to classrooms. 
      Our foundation works relentlessly to bridge this gap by building schools, libraries, and supporting students and teachers in marginalized communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is to unlock the power of education and sustainable development to transform lives. Alongside education, we also run a cow ranch to support rural livelihoods and self-sustainability for local families.
